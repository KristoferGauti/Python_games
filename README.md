## Python Games  
In this repository are games that I code in my freetime. The TUI games are coded with python, no libraries used and the other games, which are not TUI, are made with the module pygame.<br>
***
In order to play the games, you must have the pygame library downloaded. If you do not have it downloaded you must type in the command:<br>
$ pip install pygame<br>
***
If you have pygame, you can run the big games (big games = many .py files) by running main.py and for the small games (small games = one .py file), you can run them by simply running the .py file that is in the folder.
